# Kubernetes Canary Deployment Project

This project demonstrates a Canary Deployment strategy in Kubernetes to safely roll out new features or updates to your application.

## Directory Structure

```

The directory structure is organized as follows:

- `kubernetes_canary_deployment/`: The main project directory.
- `k8s/`: Contains all Kubernetes configuration files and documentation related to the Canary Deployment.
- `k8s/initial-deployment.yaml`: Initial version of the application.
- `k8s/canary-deployment.yaml`: Canary version of the application.
- `k8s/service.yaml`: Kubernetes Service for exposing the application.
- `k8s/nginx-ingress.yaml`: NGINX Ingress for routing traffic.
- `k8s/README.md`: Detailed documentation for the Kubernetes part of the project.

## Initial Deployment

The `initial-deployment.yaml` file defines the Kubernetes Deployment for the initial version of your application. It deploys three replicas and exposes them via a Service.

## Canary Deployment

The `canary-deployment.yaml` file defines the Kubernetes Deployment for the Canary version of your application. It deploys one replica, allowing you to test the new version with a small portion of the traffic.

## Service

The `service.yaml` file defines the Kubernetes Service that exposes your application to the external world. It uses port 80.

## NGINX Ingress

The `nginx-ingress.yaml` file sets up an NGINX Ingress controller to route traffic to different versions of your application based on the URL path. The default path routes to the initial version, while the `/canary` path routes to the Canary version.

## How to Use

1. Deploy the `initial-deployment.yaml` and `service.yaml` files to create the initial version of the application and expose it.

2. Deploy the `canary-deployment.yaml` file to create the Canary version of the application.

3. Deploy the `nginx-ingress.yaml` file to route traffic.

4. Monitor the Canary Deployment and gradually increase traffic to it as needed.

5. Make informed decisions based on feedback and performance.

## Conclusion

This project provides a basic structure and example configuration files for implementing a Canary Deployment in Kubernetes. Feel free to adapt and extend this structure to suit your specific application and requirements.
