```

**Directory Structure Explanation:**

- `ci_cd_k8s/`: The main project directory for your CI/CD setup in Kubernetes.

- `jenkins/`: This directory contains configuration files related to the Jenkins CI/CD setup using Helm charts.

  - `values.yaml`: Helm values file for configuring Jenkins. You can customize it with your settings.

  - `README.md`: Detailed documentation for setting up Jenkins in Kubernetes using Helm.

- `README.md`: The main README file for your entire project, providing an overview and links to the documentation within the `jenkins/` directory.

**Step 1: Add Helm Repository**

Add the Jenkins Helm repository to your Helm configuration:

```bash
helm repo add jenkins https://charts.jenkins.io
helm repo update
```

**Step 2: Create a Namespace**

Create a separate namespace for Jenkins:

```bash
kubectl create namespace jenkins
```

**Step 3: Customize Helm Values**

In the `jenkins/` directory, create a Helm values file (`values.yaml`) with your desired configuration options. Below is a simplified example:

```yaml
# jenkins/values.yaml
controller:
  serviceType: LoadBalancer
  adminUser: admin
  adminPassword: password
```

You can customize the values as needed, such as specifying the service type, admin credentials, and other configuration options.

**Step 4: Install Jenkins Using Helm**

Install Jenkins using the Helm chart with your custom values file:

```bash
helm install jenkins jenkins/jenkins -f values.yaml --namespace jenkins
```

**Step 5: Access Jenkins**

After installation, access Jenkins using the service's URL provided by the Helm chart, such as LoadBalancer IP or NodePort, depending on your configuration.

**Step 6: Unlock Jenkins**

Retrieve the unlock key during the initial access, as described in previous responses, and unlock Jenkins.

**Step 7: Configure Jenkins**

Follow the Jenkins setup wizard to customize your CI/CD server as needed. Customize it with additional plugins, build agents, and CI/CD job configurations.

You now have a Jenkins CI/CD server set up in your Kubernetes cluster using Helm charts, following a professional directory structure for your project. You can use Jenkins to automate your application deployment pipeline, integrate with version control systems, and perform various CI/CD tasks. Ensure you secure your Jenkins server with proper authentication, authorization, and security configurations as needed for your specific use case.
