# CI/CD Project: Docker Image Build and Push

![Docker Logo](https://www.docker.com/sites/default/files/d8/2019-07/horizontal-logo-monochromatic-white.png)

This project demonstrates a CI/CD pipeline for building Docker images for multiple services and pushing them to a private container registry. It is designed to provide a structured development workflow for containerized applications.

## Project Overview

In this project, we create a CI/CD pipeline that automates the process of building Docker images for individual services and pushing them to a private container registry. This allows for efficient development, testing, and deployment of containerized applications.

- `ci_cd_project/`: The main project directory.
- `services/`: A directory containing subdirectories for each service, each with its Dockerfile and other service-specific files.
- `scripts/`: A directory for custom scripts used in the CI/CD process, such as the script for building and pushing Docker images.
- `.gitignore`: A file specifying which files and directories to ignore in version control (customized for your project).
- `README.md`: The main README file for your project.
- `pipeline.yaml`: The configuration file for your CI/CD pipeline (e.g., for Jenkins, GitLab CI/CD, etc.).

## How to Build and Push Docker Images

1. Customize Dockerfiles: Each service should have its Dockerfile (`services/serviceX/Dockerfile`) customized for its specific requirements.

2. Configure Registry: In the `scripts/build_and_push_images.sh` script, specify the registry details (REGISTRY_URL, your-registry-username, your-registry-password).

3. Build and Push Images: Run the script to build and push Docker images for all services to the private container registry:

   ```bash
   ./scripts/build_and_push_images.sh
   ```

4. Verify Images: Verify that the Docker images are successfully pushed to the registry.

## CI/CD Pipeline Configuration

Depending on your CI/CD tool (e.g., Jenkins, GitLab CI/CD), configure the pipeline to execute the `scripts/build_and_push_images.sh` script. The configuration details vary by the CI/CD tool used in your project.

## Additional Notes

- Customize the `.gitignore` file to specify files and directories to ignore in version control, based on your project's requirements.

- Adapt the CI/CD pipeline configuration (`pipeline.yaml`) to match your specific CI/CD tool and container registry setup.

- Ensure that your Docker images are built and pushed to a secure and private container registry for production use.

- Provide additional project-specific information in your README as needed.

Enjoy your CI/CD workflow for Docker image building and pushing!
